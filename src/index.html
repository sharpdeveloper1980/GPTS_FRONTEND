  <meta property="og:description" content="We believe that there is a new way to look into everything around us. Anything that we see, use or witness is an outcome of a novel idea, after all. Our passion for education, love for media and fascination for technology gave us an opportunity to look beyond the ways of how institutions were communicating, how they were being compared and whether they were able to create happiness engagement. It was once an idea that institutions should tell stories and not advertise, it was once a dream that studentsâ€™ voice should be looked upon as the most important tool to bring change and communicate further. It was once thought that happiness should be measured. The dream to create a platform that would allow institutes to communicate with millions of people through a trusted medium, that would bring students at the forefront to evaluate their own institutes, that would look into the best use of technology for delivering a new way of enrolling cohorts, finally started falling in place from dream into a reality in 2012." />
